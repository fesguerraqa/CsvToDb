Wrote a tool to read a CSV file and then write it into a DB.

Case:
As an operator/tester, I want to be able to save my test results from a CSV file into a DB.

Requirements:
Req 10.1 - There will be a GUI for an operator to import a CSV file and save into a DB.

Req 10.2 - The tool will reject a file that has already been processed.

Req 10.3 - The tool will graciously reject the already processed file.

Req 10.4 - The tool will allow a user to re-import a different file on a case of a failed attempt.
